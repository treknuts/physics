# Measurement  

`measurement = number & unit`

## Base Units
- Time: seconds (s)
- Length: meter (m)
- Mass: killogram (kg)
- Electric current: Ampere (A)
- Temperature - Kelvin (K)
- Amount of a substance: mole (mol)
- Luminous Intensity - candela (cd)

## Example

Units of other quantities are derived from 7 base units.

E.g. `Area = x * y = m^s`

E.g. `Speed = v = d/t = m/s`

E.g. `V (cone) = 1/3 * pi * r^2 * h = m^3 = m^2 * m^1`

Derived units are named after notable scientists.

Examples

- Unit of force: newton `N = kg * m / s^2`
- Unit of energy: joule `J = kg * m^2 / s^2`
- Unit of pressure: pascal `Pa = kg / m * s^2`
